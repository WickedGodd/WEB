<h1> ABOUT WW2 </h1>
<p>

World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.</p><br>

<p>Historians from many countries have given deep attention to the causes of World War II. Leading themes include the political takeover in 1933 of Germany by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, which ruthlessly promoted an aggressive foreign policy in violation of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, Japanese militarism against China, Italian aggression against Ethiopia, and the success of Germany in forming an agreement with the Soviet Union in August 1939 to divide up Eastern Europe. The immediate precipitating event was Germany invading Poland on September 1, 1939, and Britain and France declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939.<p>

<p>Deep anger arose in Weimar Germany that experienced strong currents of revanchism after the Treaty of Versailles that punished Germany for causing World War I in 1918. Complaints focused on the demilitarization of Germany's Rhineland, the prohibition of unification with Austria, and the loss of some German-speaking territories. The loss of overseas colonies was a less prominent issue. Germans said they had endorsed Wilson's Fourteen Points in good faith, but the points were ignored. Versailles imposed severe conditions to prevent Germany from ever becoming a military power again, as well as heavy financial reparations. Resentment and hatred of other countries was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many activists rejected the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic. The most extreme politician was Adolf Hitler And his violent Nazi party. They took totalitarian power in Germany starting in 1933 and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. The ambitious and aggressive foreign policy reflected Nazi ideology, such as Anti-Semitism, unification of all Germans; the acquisition of "living space" (Lebensraum) for agrarian settlers (Blut und Boden), creating a "pull towards the East" (Drang nach Osten) (that is, Poland and Russia); the elimination of Bolshevism; and the hegemony of an "Aryan"/"Nordic" Master Race over the "sub-humans" (Untermenschen) of Jews and Slavs.<p>
